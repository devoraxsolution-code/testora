## 📋 System Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Python**: Version `3.9` or higher
- **Node.js**: Version `18.0` or higher
- **npm**: Version `9.0` or higher

## 🚀 How to Start the Application

To run the complete system, you will start two servers in separate terminal windows:
1. **Backend Server** (FastAPI on Port `8000`)
2. **Frontend Server** (Next.js on Port `3000`)

---

### Terminal 1: Backend Server (FastAPI)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/meet/Desktop/quiz_application
   ```

2. Activate the Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Ensure environment variables are loaded in `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
   SECRET_KEY=super-secret-key-change-in-production
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./quiz.db
   ```

4. Launch the FastAPI Uvicorn server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

> **Confirmation**: The backend is running when you see `Application startup complete` and server process started on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### Terminal 2: Frontend Server (Next.js)

1. Open a second terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/meet/Desktop/quiz_application/frontend
   ```

2. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> **Confirmation**: The frontend is running when you see `Ready in ...` on `http://localhost:3000`.
